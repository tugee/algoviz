# Week 3

## What did I accomplish?
This week's workload was hindered by the models of computation (Laskennan mallit) exam I had on the day before the deadline, preparation to which prevented me from making sizeable progress with the project.
I did however start fleshing out some code and get the ball rolling on the implementation of Dijkstra's.

## What did I learn this week?
Not much in terms of new stuff learned.

## What was confusing/unclear?
Dijkstra's implementation proved to be more challenging than I thought, with questions arising how the grid should be encoded and what functionalities should the classes have so that they are compatible with the UI.

## What will I do next?
Create the necessary Unit tests. Implement A* and begin work on UI. Put way more hours in, now that time permits.

## Time
This weeks workload was around 6 hours.
