# Week 1

## What did I accomplish?
In Week 1 I settled on the topic of algorithm visualization. I mapped out the different possible algorithms to use and decided to settle on implementing A* and Dijkstra's algorithm. 
I created the GitHub repository and intialized the project environment on NetBeans.

## What did I learn this week?
Basics of the functionality and applications of the A* algorithm. How A* and Dijkstra relate to eachother. 
Revised my understanding of Dijkstra's and refreshed my memory of the data structures required for this project, namely priority queue and heap.

## What was confusing/unclear?
Initially, the setup of the course, as this is my first laboratory course, and I have only prior experience from courses, where tests are done automatically and the 

## What will I do next?
In week 2 my goal is to implement both of the needed algorithms. I will also need to better my understanding of unit testing and best practices taught in the programming techniques course. 

## Time
This weeks workload was around 4 hours.
