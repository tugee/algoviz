# Week 5

## What did I accomplish?
I relentlessly tried to debug my JPS implementation which suffered from pruning neighbours incorrectly and getting stuck in infinite loops. Unfortunately it does not work in all instances yet. Unfortunately this meant I was unable to progress on any other parts of the project.

## What did I learn this week?
Debugging efficiently.

## What will I do next?
Next week will be the final push. I will fix JPS, which I hope should not take too long. I will also need to write all the documentation, unit tests and performance testing. I will also implement animation if I have time. If I am able to fix the bugs quickly, I will refactor some of the code and fix checkstyle errors.

## Time
This weeks workload was around 20 hours.
