# Week 5

## What did I accomplish?
I implemented the JPS algorithm. 

## What did I learn this week?
How JPS works.

## What was confusing/unclear?
JPS has been a tough algorithm to find information on. Apart from the initial white-paper and less-than-useful blogposts there is not as much digestible information on it as for Dijkstra or A*.

## What will I do next?
Will need to create an ArrayList and Heap data structure replacements. Fixing the bugs with JPS. Creating the animations required for 
Commenting the code thoroughly. 

## Time
This weeks workload was around 15 hours.
