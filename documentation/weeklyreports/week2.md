# Week 2

## What did I accomplish?
In Week 2 I spent time implementing both the Dijkstra's algorithm using Java's priorityqueue and.
Added JaCoCo to allow for tracking of test coverage.

## What did I learn this week?
Read more about the algorithms I will be implementing. Scoured through a few other projects and their weekly reports to better understand the workflow and approaches taken in developing the project and the structure of the software.

## What was confusing/unclear?
Creating the structure of the project. What part to begin the development at first. Unit testing.

## What will I do next?
I will need to plan my workflow better. Finish the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm. Start implementing the A* and JPS algorithms and creating the necessary unit tests. Replace the inbuilt Java data structures with self-created ones and start developing the UI.

## Time
This weeks workload was around 5 hours.
