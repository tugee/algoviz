# Using AlgoViz

Running the application is simple by running the project .jar with the java command:
```
java -jar tiralabra-1.0-SNAPSHOT
```
## Using the program
After launching the program using the jar, using the program is simple.

First, select the desired map from the drop down menu and press the "Load map" button. After this, select from the drop down menu with "Wall" selected and select Start/Finish to set the beginning and end of the pathfinding algorithms. After this run your desired algorithms using the respective Find path buttons. The canvas showing the map will now draw the respective algorithms path with A* having a red path and blue color for nodes considered in the minimum heap, Dijkstra has magenta for the path and orange for the considered nodes. JPS marks the nodes visited during recursion with gray and the jump nodes in light green.
